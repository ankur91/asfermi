#summary Opcodes for the data movement instructions

Note: round brackets, instead of square brackets, are used to represent an optional component. This is to avoid confusion with memory operands which are surrounded by square brackets.

Also, [Opcode#imme immea] and [SourceFormat#Composite_operand composite operand] may be mentioned in the parts below. Please visit these two links for more information regarding their meaning.

=== Data Movement Instructions ===

==== MOV ====
Instruction usage:
{{{
MOV reg0, composite operand;
}}}
If a hex number is used as the second operand, it cannot be longer than 20 bits.
Template opcode:
{{{
0010 011110 1110 000000 000000 0000000000000000000000 0000000000 010100
                   reg0   reg1                  immea
}}}

----
==== LD ====
Instruction usage:
{{{
LD(.type) reg0, [reg1(+0xabcd)];
}}}
Template opcode:
{{{
1010 000100 1110 000000 000000 00000000000000000000000000000000 000001
        mod        reg0   reg1                           0xabcd
}}}

==== LDU ====
Instruction usage:
{{{
LD(.type) reg0, [reg1(+0xabcd)];
}}}
Template opcode
{{{
1010 000100 1110 000000 000000 00000000000000000000000000000000 010001
        mod        reg0   reg1                           0xabcd
}}}

----
==== LDS ====
Load shared memory.

Instruction usage:
{{{
LDS(.type) reg0, [reg1(+0xabcd)];
}}}
Note that 0xabcd should not be greater than 0xFFFF. However, for the sake of experimentation, 0xabcd can have a maximal length of 20 bits.

Template opcode
{{{
1010 000100 1110 000000 000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000010 000011
        mod        reg0   reg1           0xabcd
}}}
For various values of mod and their meaning please refer to the LD instruction above.

----
==== ST ====
Instruction usage:
{{{
ST(.type) [reg1(+0xabcd)], reg0;
}}}
Template opcode:
{{{
1010 000100 1110 000000 000000 00000000000000000000000000000000 001001
                   reg0   reg1                           0xabcd
}}}
For various values of mod and their meaning please refer to the LD instruction above.

----
==== STS ====
Store shared memory.

Instruction usage:
{{{
STS(.type) [reg1(+0xabcd)], reg0;
}}}
Note: the same restriction that applies to LDS applies to STS as well.

Template opcode
{{{
1010 000100 1110 000000 000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000010 010011
        mod        reg0   reg1           0xabcd
}}}
For various values of mod and their meaning please refer to the LD instruction above.
