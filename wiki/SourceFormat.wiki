#summary Source format specification

= Source Code Format =

This file specifies the format that should be taken by the source assembly code

General rules:
  * The source file sent to the assembler should only contain 3 types of lines:
    * Directive
    * Instruction
    * Comment
  * Everything is case-sensitive
  * If a line contains a directive, it must not contain any other directives or instructions. However, comments could be inserted right after the directive.

----
==Directives==
Use:
  * Declare symbols: kernel (parameters), texture symbol, constant memory, shared memory, external symbols
  * Send specific commands to the assembler
For a list of directives that are supported/to be supported, see [Directives].

Format:
{{{
!directive_name argument1 argument2...
}}}
[Features State]: 2
Note: labels are written as directives.
----
==Instructions==
For a list of instructions that are supported/to be supported, see [Instructions].

Format:
{{{
NAME OP1 [ OP2 [OP3]]
name.mod1.mod2 op1, [ op2, [op3]]
}}}

General rules:
  * Everything in cuobjdump format should be upper-case
  * Everything in PTX-like format should be lower-case
  * The assembler does not enforce the use of the semi-colon. It could be used in a line to separate one instruction from another

State: 1
----
==Comments==
Comments are exactly the same as as in C/C++.

Format:
{{{
//in-line comment

/*
block comment
*/
}}}
State: 1
