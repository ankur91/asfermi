#summary A log file of updates

==== 8th June, 2011 ====
12am: Spent the last day debugging and fixing the potential performance issues. The first release should be within 2 days.

*5pm*: Spent 5 hours coding today. I think I'll take a break for now. Progress is better than I imagined. I'm now at the stage of writing instruction-specific parsing functions. Also, there are quite a lot of performance issues I could foresee, but I'm not bothered to make any change for now.

==== 5th June, 2011 ====
I've been having headache since yesterday afternoon. Things may slow down a little.

*11pm*: My headache is gone, but progress is rather slow, because I'm learning C++'s various features and coding at the same time. I just reinvented an exception handling mechanism before I realized that C++ does have support for proper exception handling. Also, I wanted to use C#'s naming convention, but soon realized that Visual Studio's Intellisense didn't work as well as I had expected, so the long variable names required by C#'s naming convention would be too much a pain to live with.

Well, maybe the first release, supporting MOV, LD, ST, EXIT, FADD, IADD and capable of only replacing opcodes in existing kernels, will not come until at least 3 days later (after 8th June).

Exam's over! I'll start coding for asfermi now!
