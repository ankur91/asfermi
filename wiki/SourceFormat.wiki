#summary Source format specification

= Introduction =

This file specifies the format that should be taken by the source assembly code

General rules:
  * Everything is case-sensitive
  * Everything in cuobjdump format should be upper-case
  * Everything in PTX-like format should be lower-case
  * The assembler does not enforce the use of the semi-colon. It could be used in a line to separate one instruction from another
  * If a line contains a directive, it must contain only the directive and no other things
  * If a line contains a label, it could contain instructions and comments as well. But the label must precede everything else.
==Directives==
Declare symbols: kernel, texture symbol, constant memory, shared memory

Format:
{{{
!directive_name argument1 argument2...
}}}
==Instructions==

Format:
{{{
NAME OP1 [ OP2 [OP3]]
name.mod1.mod2 op1, [ op2, [op3]]
}}}

==label==

Format:
{{{
label_name:
}}}

==Comments==
Comments are treated exactly the same as as in C/C++.
