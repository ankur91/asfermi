== Known Issues ==
  # cuobjdump suggests that the 20-bit address for constant memory in some composite operands should be rotated by 1 bit. Whether this is a bug of cuobjdump or something that the hardware mandates is not confirmed. This rotation is currently not implemented in any composite operand parsers.
  # Error messages are reused too often and some errors will not trigger the correct error message.
  # No warning is given when the parsing of some floating point/integer expressions using atoi(), atol() or atof() produce errors.

== Others ==
  # 64-bit output is not yet supported
