#summary Opcodes for the data movement instructions

Note: round brackets, instead of square brackets, are used to represent an optional component. This is to avoid confusion with memory operands which are surrounded by square brackets.

Also, [Opcode#imme immea] and [SourceFormat#Composite_operand composite operand] may be mentioned in the parts below. Please visit these two links for more information regarding their meaning.
