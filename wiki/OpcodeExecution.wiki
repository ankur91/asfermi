#summary opcodes for execution control instructions

Note: round brackets, instead of square brackets, are used to represent an optional component. This is to avoid confusion with memory operands which are surrounded by square brackets.

Also, [Opcode#imme immea] and [SourceFormat#Composite_operand composite operand] may be mentioned in the parts below. Please visit these two links for more information regarding their meaning.

=== Execution Control Instructions ===

==== CAL ====
Instruction usage:
{{{
CAL(.NOINC) (-)0xabcd;
}}}
0xabcd is the address relative to the address of the instruction right after the CAL instruction. Note that the cuobjdump would output the absolute address of the target instruction in the kernel instead of the relative address. 0xabcd cannot 24 bits in length. 

Template opcode:
{{{
1110 000000 0000 001000 000000 000000000000000000000000 00000000 001010
                   mod2                          0xabcd
}}}
