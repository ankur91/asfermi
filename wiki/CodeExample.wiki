#summary A few examples of how the source files look like


Here's an example source file used for the "direct output mode" of asfermi.
{{{
!Kernel kernel1
!Param 4

MOV R1, c [0x1] [0x100];
NOP CC.T; //for sm_21
MOV R0, c [0x0] [0x20];
MOV R2, 0xff;
ST  [R0], R2;
EXIT;

!EndKernel
}}}
This file is assembled with the following command line:
{{{
asfermi test.txt -o test.cubin
}}}

Here's an example of the source file used for the "replace mode" of asfermi.
{{{
MOV R2, 0x20;
LD R3, [R0];
}}}
It is assembled with the following command line:
{{{
asfermi test.txt -r target.cubin targetkernek 0x10 //replaces opcodes at 0x10 and 0x18
}}}
