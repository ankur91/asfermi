=Basic types=
{{{
struct Line
{
  public:
    char* line_content;
    int line_number;
}
struct Directive:: public Line
{
  public:
    int directive_type;
    int* directive_content; //array of pointers specific to each directive_type
}
struct Instruction:: public Line
{
}
}}}

=Global states=
All the global states will be contained in a single struct
  * int line_number
  * List of directives encountered
  * bool inside_multi_line_comment
  * int current_parser

=Stages=
==Source file processing==
  * Read source file
  * Split source file into char`*``*`, with each char`*` containing one line
  * foreach( char`*` in char`*``*`)  {  parse(char`*`) }
==Parsing==
  * Ignore if this line is inside a multi-line comment section
  * Remove unnecessary white-space and in-line comment
