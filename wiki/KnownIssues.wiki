== Known Issues ==
  # .64 and .128 modifiers have not been properly supported as they do not cause the register count to increase by 2/4 respectively.
  # Constant memory banks 0x10 and above are not supported for now.
  # Error messages are reused too often and some errors will not trigger the correct error message.
  # No warning is given when the parsing of some floating point/integer expressions using atoi(), atol() or atof() produce errors.

== Others ==
  # Memory leaks are not being dealt with.
